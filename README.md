# XLIDO

Project Summary
The Xlido project is a command-line application inspired by Slido, designed to enhance event engagement and interaction. The application allows users to create and manage events, post and manage questions, and interact with questions through upvotes and replies. By implementing Xlido, the project aims to strengthen your Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills and deepen your understanding of building interactive applications using Java.



Project Deliverables
Core Functionality Implementation:
- User Management:
- CREATE_USER: Implemented the ability to create a new user with a unique email and password.
- Event Management:
- CREATE_EVENT: Implemented the functionality to create a new event with a unique event ID.
- DELETE_EVENT: Added functionality to delete an existing event.
- Question Management:
- ADD_QUESTION: Enabled users to post questions to specific events.
- DELETE_QUESTION: Allowed users to delete questions they have posted.
- UPVOTE_QUESTION: Added the ability to upvote a question posted in an event.
- REPLY_QUESTION: Implemented functionality for users to reply to existing questions.
- LIST_QUESTION: Allowed users to list questions in an event, with the ability to sort them by various criteria.

Command-Line Interface:
- Designed and implemented a command-line interface to accept and process user commands.
- Developed parsers for various command formats to ensure correct input handling and processing.

Data Storage and Retrieval:
- Implemented in-memory data structures to manage users, events, and questions.
- Ensured efficient storage and retrieval of data to support real-time interaction and data processing.

Unit Testing:
- Developed comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness of each implemented feature.
- Ensured that all commands produce the correct output and handle edge cases properly.



Skills + Tech Stacks
Tech Stack:
- Java for core application development
- JUnit for unit testing
- Basic data structures (e.g., HashMap, List) for data storage

Skills Demonstrated:
- Object-Oriented Programming: Applied OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to build a modular and maintainable application.
- Command-Line Interface Design: Developed a user-friendly command-line interface to interact with the application.
- Data Structures: Utilized basic data structures like HashMap and List to store and manage application data efficiently.
- Error Handling: Implemented error handling for various scenarios, such as invalid inputs and actions on non-existent entities.
- Unit Testing: Wrote unit tests using JUnit to validate the correctness and robustness of the application.
- Code Modularity: Ensured a modular codebase with clear separation of concerns, making the application easy to extend and maintain.
